The image files are included in this project as a linked resoruce.

The original images will be installed into the Microsoft SDK folder by the Windows Phone Developer Tools installer.  

On 64 bit Windows this is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.1\Icons\dark\

On 32 bit Windows this is:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.1\Icons\dark\

Because this project was originally built on 64 bit windows, it uses the (x86) location. 
You may need to remove and re-add the image if you are running this project on 32 bit Windows.
