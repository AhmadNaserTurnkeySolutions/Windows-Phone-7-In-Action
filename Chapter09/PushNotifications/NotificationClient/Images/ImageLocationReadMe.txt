The image file appbar.save.rest.png is included in this project as linked resoruces.

The original images will be installed into the Microsoft SDK folder by the Windows Phone Developer Tools installer.  

On 64 bit Windows this is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.0\Icons\dark\

On 32 bit Windows this is:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.0\Icons\dark\

Because this project was originally built on 64 bit windows, it uses the (x86) location. 
You may need to remove and re-add the image if you are running this project on 32 bit Windows.
